</script></section>

<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Lab Procedure

- First 30 mins: Take a **quiz** on that week's material and submit.
- Rest of the time you can either:
  - Get help on homework from TAs. 
  - Work on extra programming / interview question challenges
- **Some labs (~3)** will be reused to allow **retakes of quizzes**
</script></section>

<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Contacting Us

- Email is fine, but please put **CS2100** in the email subject. This helps us organize our emails and more efficiently get back to you.
- We are going to ask that you **first contact a head TA** regarding any issue. If that person cannot resolve your issue, then we will be happy to help.
  - Not trying to avoid you, but it is a big class.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Tools

- We will use the following tools primarily
  - Our course website: [https://uva-cs.github.io/dsa1](https://uva-cs.github.io/dsa1)
  - Collab workspace
  - [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com)
  - [Piazza](https://piazza.com)
</script></section>

<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Course Website

- Our [course website](https://uva-cs.github.io/dsa1) contains most of the information you'll need this semester.
  - link to the Syllabus
  - Schedule of lectures
  - Links to slides
  - Homework assignment writeups, starting code, tutorials, etc.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Collab

- We will use Collab sparingly, however:
  - You will have one quiz on Collab (the syllabus quiz)
  - Final grades will be posted there (eventually)
  - Will contain links to other resources (course website, etc.)
</script></section>

<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Gradescope

- All of our homework submission will be done on [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com)
- **Homeworks** will be submitted.
  - Most of the programming assignments are autograded
  - Reports and a couple of programming assignments are manually graded
</script></section>

<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Sherlock (Quizzes)

- **Quizzes** will be taken at[sherlock.cs.virginia.edu](https://sherlock.cs.virginia.edu)
</script></section>

<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Piazza

- [Piazza](https://piazza.com) is a great tool for asking questions about course content. 
- TAs will monitor and answer questions throughout the semester.
- Instructor may or may not be on Piazza consistently.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Expectations

- You have **taken CS111x** (or equivalent) and earned a C- or above.
- You can do the following:
  - You understand variables, program flow, simple problem solving, etc.
  - You understand simple data types like floats / doubles, strings, integers, etc. (though the names you used might be different)
  - You can write simple functions, pass parameters, write loops, use arrays, iterate over lists, etc.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Python vs. Java

- Many of you learned **Python** as you first language
  - Learning your second language will have some overhead, but you can do it and we are here to help you! You are **not behind**!!
- And many of you already have **Java** experience
  - Great! You will likely be bored for about 3-4 weeks. Please don't complain (I don't care that you already know SO much stuff)
</script></section>

<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Lab and Lecture Swap

- If you want to swap lecture or lab, you can:
  - **Do a lab/lecture swap in SIS**. Only works of the destination sections are open / have space.
  - **Find someone to swap with**. Then ask Jesse Rogers in Thornton to manually swap you. I cannot do this for you.

### Course Content
</script></section>

<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Course Goals

By the end of the semester, students should be able to:
- Understand how to write programs in Java, including all basic structures (e.g., if-statements, loops, functions), recursion, objects, methods, inheritance / polymorphism, and exception throwing / handling.
- Understand and implement several key data structures, required for a foundational education in computer science. These data structures include Vectors, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Hash Tables, and Priority Queues.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Course Goals

By the end of the semester, students should be able to:
- Understand and implement various sorting methods, including bubble sort, insertion sort, mergesort, quicksort, and heapsort.
- Understand and analyze program analysis using practical approaches (e.g., mergesort vs. quicksort) and theoretical approaches (e.g., balanced vs. unbalanced search trees). This will include both space and time complexity analyses.
- Gather an abstract and basic understanding of concurrency and associated issues (shared resources, etc.). Students will be able to implement simple multi-threaded programs in Java. 
</script></section>

<section data-markdown class="center"><script type="text/template">
### Course Tools

- You will need to download [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org), a development tool for **Java**
